| `Data Mart` | Indefinite iteration, in which the code block executes until some condition is met. With indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. Rather, the designated block is executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met. |

| `Zero ETL` | Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. With definite iteration, the number of times the designated block will be executed is specified explicitly at the time the loop starts. |
