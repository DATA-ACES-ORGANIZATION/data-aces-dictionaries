| Term | Meaning |

| `For Loops` | Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. With definite iteration, the number of times the designated block will be executed is specified explicitly at the time the loop starts. |
| `While Loops` | Indefinite iteration, in which the code block executes until some condition is met. With indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. Rather, the designated block is executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met. |
| `Sentinel value` | In computer programming, a sentinel value (also referred to as a flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, or dummy data) is a special value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination, typically in a loop or recursive algorithm. |
| `server` | Backend |
| `client` | Frontend |
| `Metadata` | Data about data. |
| `Programs` | Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs (Niklaus Wirth). |
| `Spike` | Technical investigation. |
| `PoC` | Proof of Concept, prototyping. |
